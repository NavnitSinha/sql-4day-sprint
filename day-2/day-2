JOINs — Like Matching People from Two Lists
  
Imagine two lists:

List A (employees) – has names and department IDs
List B (departments) – has department IDs and names

You want to connect them and get the actual department name for each employee.

👉 INNER JOIN
  
Only gives you people that exist in both lists (matching dept_id).

SELECT emp.name, dept.name
FROM emp
JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;
  
🧠 Think: “Only give me employees who actually belong to a known department.”

👉 LEFT JOIN
  
Returns all employees, even if their dept_id doesn’t match anything in departments.

SELECT emp.name, dept.name
FROM emp
LEFT JOIN dept ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;
  
🧠 Think: “Give me every employee, and add their department name if we know it—otherwise, just put NULL.”

🔁 GROUP BY — Like Grouping Boxes by Color and Counting What's Inside
  
Imagine:
You’re running a shop and tracking sales. Each row = 1 sale.
Now you want to group sales by employee and find totals.

SELECT emp_id, SUM(sale_amount)
FROM sales
GROUP BY emp_id;

🧠 Think: “Group all sales by employee, then add up each employee’s sales.”

⚙️ Common Aggregation Functions
  
Function	   What it does	            Example
  
SUM()	       Adds values	            Total sales
COUNT()	     Counts rows	            How many sales made
AVG()	       Averages values	        Average salary
MAX()	       Highest value	          Highest sale
MIN()	       Lowest value	            Lowest salary

  
TL;DR – You’re Basically Saying:

JOIN = "Get me more info from another table"
GROUP BY = "Group by this thing and do math on each group"
SUM/COUNT/etc = "Do quick math on that group"
