SQL Sprint â€“ Day 3: Complex SQL Queries
  
ðŸŽ¯ Topics:

Subqueries (a query inside a query)
Aliases (AS)
Nested SELECTs
Letâ€™s break it down smooth:

ðŸ§  1. Alias (AS) â€” rename things for clarity

SELECT name AS customer_name FROM customers;
Renames name column to customer_name in the result.

You can also alias tables:

SELECT c.name, o.amount
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON c.id = o.customer_id;

ðŸ§  2. Subquery â€” a query inside a query
  
Imagine you want to get customers who made the highest order:

SELECT name FROM customers
WHERE id = (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
  ORDER BY amount DESC
  LIMIT 1
);

What it does:
First, the subquery:
SELECT customer_id FROM orders ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1
â†’ Finds the ID of the customer with the biggest order
Then, the outer query finds that customerâ€™s name

ðŸ§  3. IN with Subquery â€” for multiple values

SELECT name FROM customers
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 300
);
â†’ This grabs customers who made any order over 300
